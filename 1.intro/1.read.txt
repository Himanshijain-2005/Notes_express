server.js
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

1. req is powerful object to know everything about sending person
2. if we wanna attach some data with url we can do by --> url?person=Himanshi and we can get
   it by req.query.person
3. we make computer server by express() and makes it listen http requests

Server2_form_get.js
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

1. to send a file in response we use sendfile(file location)
2. form action me vo url de denge jispr hum jana chahte hai form ation='/greet' and submit krte 
time jo input me denge vo url me query ki trh attach ho jayega 
like run server2_form_get.js then 127.0.0.1:4444/form go to this then write name in input like Himanshi
then url is directed to http://127.0.0.1:4444/greet?person=himanshi . because form action
is '/greet' and input person is attached as querry

server3_form_post.js
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

till now we are submitting form by get which is by default.
but we can change method by method=post
and if we submit form then it will show error because
we need to define post method for /greet in server2_form.js and in post method we cannot take query 
value from url because post gives more security and data submitted is in body.
but to acess req we need to use middleware.middleware runs on req object before all get and post req.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

for Postman  run server3_form_post.js
go to post and url and localhost://greet and give data in body and person

server4_params.js
"/:city" by writing : city is passed as parameter in url and can be acessed using req.params.city
